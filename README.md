A Frontend project that has helped me to practice the following skills:    
    1. Responsive designing      
        - CSS Media Queries  
        - Grid  
        - CSS Flexbox    
    2. Accessibility tools  
        - WAI-ARIA  
        - Appropriate HTML Semantics  
   


The application has been built using CSS and HTML5 to create a presentational mobile mockup and the page.
